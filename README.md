This Python script simulates a simple restaurant ordering system.
It features a predefined menu with items and their respective prices. 
The script prompts the user to order items from the menu, checks 
the availability of the items, and calculates the total cost of the order.

Menu
- Pizza: Rs40
- Pasta: Rs50
- Burger: Rs60
- Salad: Rs70
- Coffee: Rs80

How It Works
1. The script welcomes the user and displays the menu.
2. The user is prompted to enter the name of the item they wish to order.
3. If the item is available on the menu, it is added to the order total.
4. The user is asked if they want to add another item.
5. If the user opts to add another item, they can enter the name of the second item,
   which is also checked for availability and added to the order total if available.
6. The script displays the total amount to be paid for the ordered items.

This description provides an overview of the script's functionality and a sample interaction for users to understand how it works.
